# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering refers to the systematic application of engeenering principles, methodologies as well as use of tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirement- this referes to the preliminary stages that involves identification of user needs interfaces as well as identifying the software architecture needs that match user interface identified.
design- this stage involves the development of code and building of the said software
testing- this stage involves testing software to see if it meets the quality standards as well as if it achieves the functionality.
deployment - this stage involves releasing the softwarefor end users after testing has happenned. 
maintenance- this is a continuos process of support, improvements and creating news updates


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology refers to software development method that involves a sequential flow in a step by step manner while agile operates in a cycling manner. the waterfall method is workable where the functional requirement have already been establish early enough, with predictable scope as well as timebound on the other hand agile works where feedback ,lexibility and collaboration are needed especially where there is uncertainity in the requirements. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
